# custom
single player modifications for d2r (also includes visual enhancements for multiplayer)

- uniques are more common
- uniques and sets can be easily gambled for
- 2x skill points per level
- 10 stat points per level
- double life/energy/stamina per point
- easier enemies in hell
- visibility enhancements for items (runes/gems/uniques/etc all easier to see)
    - these apply online to BNET as well (use at own risk but know that risk of ban from this is very low)
- shortened potion and scroll names (since they are so common)
